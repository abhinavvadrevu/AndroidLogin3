This is a super hacky android app which which talks to a simple backend I designed.  It's my first android app, and I wrote it in <15 hours, so please be forgiving with my not so good coding practices haha I just wanted to build a working app as quickly as possible.  This is not a great template for anyone to use.  It requires a lot of cleaning up.
